\chapter{Implementation}

The module that was developed to realise the experiments in this thesis has been made available online on \url{https://github.com/dieuwkehupkes/Thesis}. The module uses the external toolkit NLTK, that can be downloaded from \url{http://nltk.org/}. For users without root access, a folder with the source code of the relevant NLTK classes is included in the git-project. If NLTK is installed on your computer, this folder may be deleted.

All classes contain a demo that demonstrates the basic workings of the class. Extensive documentation of all classes, that should suffice for both using and extending the current functionality, is provided in this appendix. Besides classes, two programs are provided:
